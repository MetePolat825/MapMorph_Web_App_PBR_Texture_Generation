# MapMorph: AI-Powered PBR Texture Generation

# Project Introduction



In the world of computer graphics and game development, manually creating PBR (Physically Based Rendering) specular textures is a time-consuming and intricate process. This workflow often requires expensive software licenses and high-end hardware setups, making it difficult for smaller teams and independent artists, such as students or those with limited financial ability to access high-quality texture generation tools.

MapMorph is an innovative web-based solution that automates the generation of PBR textures directly from real-world photos. This tool streamlines the texture creation process, removing common barriers such as:

- The need for licensed software like Substance Painter
- Expensive hardware requirements
- Installation processes
- Platform dependence

By leveraging AI-powered enhancements and modern web technologies, MapMorph provides a fast, scalable, and accessible method for creating high-quality textures. It‚Äôs designed to make texture creation easier for 3D artists, game developers, and other professionals in the creative industries.

## Key Features

- Automated Texture Generation: Quickly convert real-world images into roughness, albedo, and normal maps with a single click.

- PBR value standardizer: This unique feature of MapMorph will make sure all of your textures adhere to the Physically Based database preset of PBR values, ensuring all of your textures work in cohesion. You can even use custom presets for Unreal or Unity or even upload your own!

- Support for multiple industry standard workflows: Roughness/Metallic and Specular/Glossiness workflows as well as Bump mapping are supported.

- User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive and accessible for both beginners and seasoned professionals.

- Scalable and Performant: Built using modern web technologies for fast, efficient processing, even with larger image files.

- AI-Powered Enhancements: Optional AI-based material segmentation that intelligently analyzes images to provide advanced texture results.

- Cross-Platform: No installation or hardware requirements. Works seamlessly across platforms using only a browser.

# Demo

You can explore a live demo of MapMorph on  [[http://mcp140.pythonanywhere.com](http://mcp140.pythonanywhere.com)] and see the texture generation process in action. The demo is hosted online, so no installation is required‚Äîsimply upload your image, process it, and download the result.

Check out a demo on YouTube!

# Step-by-Step Usage

### 1. Upload Your Image:
Drag and drop or select an image from your computer to begin. Supported formats: JPG, PNG, and TIFF.

### 2.Process the Image: 
Once the image is uploaded, click the "Process" button to automatically generate PBR textures. The AI-powered backend will analyze the image and produce roughness, albedo, and normal maps.

### 3.Download the Textures: 
After processing, you can download the generated textures in either PNG or TGA format. Perfect for use in game engines like Unity, Unreal Engine, or 3D modeling software.
     
Example Output: After processing, MapMorph generates the following PBR texture maps:

- Albedo Map (Diffuse)
- Roughness Map
- Normal Map

## CI/CD Workflow

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). The GitHub Actions workflow automates the following tasks:

- **Code Testing**: Each push or pull request triggers automated tests using `pytest` to ensure the quality of the code.
- **Deployment**: After passing the tests, the application is automatically deployed to **PythonAnywhere**, a platform that hosts Python applications.

### GitHub Actions

The CI/CD pipeline is defined in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file. The pipeline includes the following steps:
1. **Install dependencies**: Install required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. **Run tests**: Execute tests using `pytest` to ensure the code works correctly.
3. **Deploy to PythonAnywhere**: Upon successful tests, the app is deployed to PythonAnywhere.

### PythonAnywhere Deployment

The project is hosted on **PythonAnywhere**, which provides a cloud-based platform for Python applications. After the GitHub Actions workflow completes, the application is automatically deployed to PythonAnywhere using the provided deployment scripts. The app can be accessed from [PythonAnywhere](https://mcp140.pythonanywhere.com/).
