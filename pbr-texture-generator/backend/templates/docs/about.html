        <h3 class="center_txt">Why Was MapMorph Created?</h3>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">In the world of computer graphics and game development, manually creating PBR (Physically Based Rendering) specular textures is a time-consuming and intricate process. This workflow often requires expensive software licenses and high-end hardware setups, making it difficult for smaller teams and independent artists—such as students or those with limited financial ability—to access high-quality texture generation tools.</p>

        <ul style="text-align: justify;">
            <li>The need for licensed software like Substance Painter</li>
            <li>Expensive hardware requirements</li>
            <li>Complex installation processes</li>
            <li>Platform dependence</li>
