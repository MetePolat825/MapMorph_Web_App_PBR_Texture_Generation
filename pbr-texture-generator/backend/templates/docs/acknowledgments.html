    <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
    <p>MapMorph wouldn't be possible without the inspiration and influence of several outstanding projects in the field of texture generation and 3D asset creation. We want to extend our gratitude to these pioneering tools:</p>

    <h2>Inspirations</h2>
    
    <h3>ArmorLab</h3>
    <p>ArmorLab is an AI-powered texture generation tool that streamlined the process of creating textures for 3D models. MapMorph was heavily inspired by its AI-driven automation approach.</p>

    <h3>Substance Sampler</h3>
    <p>Adobe’s Substance Sampler provides advanced material creation workflows that informed MapMorph’s approach to procedural and AI-based texture generation.</p>

    <h3>Polycam</h3>
    <p>Polycam is a 3D scanning application that influenced MapMorph’s approach to photorealistic texture capture and processing.</p>

    <h2>Special Thanks</h2>
    <p>We’d also like to thank the open-source communities that provide the libraries and frameworks used in MapMorph, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>TensorFlow and PyTorch for AI processing</li>
        <li>Three.js for WebGL rendering</li>
        <li>OpenCV for image processing</li>
        <li>Node.js and Flask for backend development</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Lastly, a huge thank you to our contributors, testers, and users who help make MapMorph better every day!</p>
